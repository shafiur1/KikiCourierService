## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull Requests are the best way to propose changes. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed behavior, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows our style.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
